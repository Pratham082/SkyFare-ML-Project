## Introduction

The Flight Price Prediction project utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict the prices of flights. By analyzing historical flight data, the model can forecast the prices for future flights, assisting users in planning their trips more efficiently.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains various features related to flights, including:
- Airline
- Date of Journey
- Source
- Destination
- Route
- Duration
- Total Stops
- Additional Info

The data is preprocessed to handle missing values, convert categorical variables into numerical values, and normalize numerical features.

## Features

The key features used for prediction include:
- **Airline:** The airline operating the flight.
- **Source:** The starting location of the flight.
- **Destination:** The ending location of the flight.
- **Total Stops:** The number of stops between the source and destination.
- **Duration:** The total duration of the flight.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing steps include:
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature scaling
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets

## Model Training

Several machine learning algorithms are utilized to train the model, including:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting

The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Evaluation

The model is evaluated on the test dataset, and its performance is compared across different algorithms. Visualizations such as bar plots and scatter plots are used to depict the model's accuracy and prediction capabilities.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
